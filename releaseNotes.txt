Multidec 8.5 by R One (2003/03)
===============================

- Started to change the satellite stuff interface so that the satellite name appears.
  There is now an external satellite list file. Still some work to do (particularly
  about motorized antennas), plugins can now use that info.
- Recording now works fine, no frame dropped. Generated files can be read with an
  other player such as Windows Media Player (but not seeked in...).
- Switching channel via keyboard when recording or playing is now disabled.
- Added stuff for internationalization. English language supported. Some support exists
  for Italian, Spanish and Portuguese (thanks to NeologiK), but resources still need to
  be translated.

Known bugs/limitations
----------------------
- You should not use the OSD when/for recording, some frames are getting lost and the
  recording is not clean. Seems to be related with the interrupt handling when the OSD
  is used.
- Playing a recorded file does not seem to work at the first try. Retrying it works.
- Seeking within recorded files with WMP does not work. May be I should add mpeg pack
  start records or correct the bitrate at the BOF.
- Still have to correct a couple of OSD screens for sound cut bug.
- As MD9.X source was not made available, so I can't incorporate other bugs correction.
- Some displayed EIT information seems incorrect (channels like Arte).

Work planned
------------
- Use the PMT during channel switch in order to get dynamic PIDs.
- Use display clipping when overlay mode is used, so that changing the display to RGB
  when displaying menus or popups is no more necessary.
- Add some code in order to be able to display unencrypted .VOB files and decode the
  AC3 sound in them.
- I don't have much time to develop these things, so it might come late...

MD 8.4 by R One (not publicly released)
=======================================

- Merged the german 8.3a and the french 8.2Fr versions.
- Added stuff for internationalization. French and german languages supported.
- The OSD fonts can now be customized via an external file (osd_font.dat, in same directory
  as the Root file). The included one has accentuated characters (for use in french, german...)
- Canalsat Radio channels are remembered their radio names.
- Better CA descriptors parsing in PMT. AC3 PIDs should now be automatically detected. Provider
  files now merged into one single file (Multidec.prv)
- A lot of cleanup, including moving big structures in malloc'ed memory, also removing all analog
  related parts.
- Programm.set files from previous 8.x versions are automatically converted to 8.4
- The firmware file Boot_up.axf is not used anymore.
- Escaped a bug within OSD : drawing dark chars on a white rectangle cause the sound to stop
  (at least on my DVB-S Rev 1.3 card).

Release notes for Multidec 8.3a (BigReaper):
============================================

- Ini-Handler did not correctly read out "LNB2_LOF_HIGH"-Value from INI-File.
  Now it does. (thx to bix777)
- MD 8.3a doesn't kill MD 8.2 programm.set files anymore. It uses the same programm.set like MD 8.2
- improved the EPG (not perfect but better than in 8.2 and 8.3)
- MD now remembers the following states:
  - cursor state (visible / not visible)
  - MD mute status
  - system volume and system mute status and restores these system settings
- DVB out only (key F12) has no function atm. Moto is working on it...
- This version DOES NOT work with W2K & SP3!

Release notes for Multidec 8.3:
===============================

- improved the EPG (not perfect but better than in 8.2)
- added a quasi full screen mode (key F11) because I hated to hide the taskbar
- volume regulation with the mouse wheel
- little quicker program start (less pictures in the splash screen)
- recording of movies that include a '?'-character is possible
 (but I can't recommend you MD to record movies, use ProgDVB instead)
- GeForce 2 users had a small white bar on the right screen side. This version fixed this thing
- added the Windows-XP fix (but I didn't tested it. I only read about that in the irdeto4free forum).
- No analog card support.

Release notes for Multidec 8.2 Fr:
==================================

- Change l'aspect de la fenêtre principale
  - Ajout de la fenêtre "FAVORIBOX" V1.0 Finale
- Ajout d'un pas de Freq. pour le scan du cable
- Ajout d'un pas de symbol pour le scan du cable
- Ajout d'une val. min. de symbol pour le scan du cable
- Ajout d'une val. max. de symbol pour le scan du cable
